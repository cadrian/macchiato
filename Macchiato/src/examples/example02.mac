/*
 * Advanced example, formerly used by Rex Potam
 * http://rex-potam.cadrian.net/
 *
 * (See rex-potam.mac)
 *
 * This ruleset fixes a few shortcomings of the MIDI production chain
 * used by the songwriter:
 *
 * - NoteWorthy Composer emits NOTE_ON(velocity=0) instead of NOTE_OFF
 *   events -- replace by NOTE_OFF, except if the PORTAMENTO pedal is on
 *
 * - NoteWorthy Composer emits all tracks, even if they are muted --
 *   an input file may be used to map the actual channels to some
 *   useful value
 *
 * - fluidsynth uses the Expression MPC as a simple volume switch,
 *   whereas Rex uses it for actual dynamics, and rough velocities for
 *   musicality (e.g. strong vs weak beats, musical phrases); these
 *   rules combine the expression and velocity to emit actual note
 *   velocities
 *
 * This also adds a bit of random for "humanization".
