**Macchiato is a MIDI file processor.**

It takes a MIDI file, transforms it using rules, and outputs another
MIDI file with the specified modifications.

This is useful to enhance a MIDI file, for instance produced by a
score writing tool (e.g. MuseScore), by adding some **humanization**
procedures and any other more-or-less fancy enhancements (to taste!)

It is used for instance by [Rex
Potam](http://rex-potam.cadrian.net/) for his songs and other
musical works.
